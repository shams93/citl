                    Getting Started with Brightspace (D2L)
                    These Winter 2018 sessions will prove very beneficial to an instructor or TA who is using Brightspace (D2L) for the first time. We’ll cover the basics to get you started. This would include: accessing Brightspace; uploading content to your course site; editing your content; setting up a discussion forum; creating a drop box for assignments; and, using the grade book.

                    These clinics will offer hands-on training in getting your course up and running. During the clinics, our expert staff will be on hand to provide guidance and address individual questions. All clinics will take place in ED-1001

<h4>Using Intelligent Agents in your Course</h4>
The Intelligent Agents tool allows instructors to set-up automatic notifications to be send to themselves and/or students when specified course performance criteria are met.
It can be used to both recognize student achievement (ex. a high score on a quiz) and warn of potential problems (ex. lack of online activity or poor performance on a quiz.).

Next Session
Please email tlx@mun.ca to register for a session.

Using Intelligent Agents: February 15th, 1:30 -3:00 PM

<h4>Brightspace (D2L) Course Setup Kit</h4>
CITL has created a Course Setup Kit for Brightspace (D2L). The setup kit includes standard “student focused” information, such as how to navigate and use Brightspace and how to access library support, links to academic regulations and more. In addition, the site has a series of editable pages where faculty can add their own course-specific content. These pages are stylized and designed to meet accessibility standards, and can be easily edited using the editor within Brightspace (D2L).

This starter kit provides a great starting point for new faculty wishing to augment their on-campus teaching with effective technology support and an efficient way for experienced instructors to move Word and PDF documents to accessible HTML pages.

To support you in implementing the Course Setup Kit for your courses, please contact us for more details.
