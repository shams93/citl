<h3>Brightspace (D2L) Sessions</h3>
<h4>Getting Started with Brightspace (D2L)</h4>

This would include: accessing Brightspace; uploading content to your course site; editing your content; setting up a discussion forum,; creating a drop box for assignments; and, using the grade book.

These clinics will offer hands-on training in getting your course up and running. During the clinics, our expert staff will be on hand to provide guidance and address individual questions. All clinics will take place in ED-1001 at the following dates and times:

<h3>Brightspace (D2L) Course Setup Kit</h3>
CITL has created a Course Setup Kit for Brightspace (D2L). The setup kit includes standard "student focused" information, such as how to navigate and use Brightspace and how to access library support, links to academic regulations and more. In addition, the site has a series of editable pages where faculty can add their own course-specific content. These pages are stylized and designed to meet accessibility standards, and can be easily edited using the editor within Brightspace (D2L).

This starter kit provides a great starting point for new faculty wishing to augment their on-campus teaching with effective technology support and an efficient way for experienced instructors to move Word and PDF documents to accessible HTML pages.

To support you in implementing the Course Setup Kit for your courses, please <a href="mailto:tlx@mun.ca">contact us</a> for more details.[/two_third_last]
